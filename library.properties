sentence=Hydruino: Simple automation controller for hydroponic grow systems.
paragraph=Allows one to set up a system of reservoirs, pumps, probes, relays, and other objects useful in automating the daily lighting, feed dosing, watering, and data monitoring & collection processes involved in hydroponically grown fruits, vegetables, teas, herbs, and salves. Works with a large variety of widely-available aquarium/hobbyist equipment, including popular GPS, RTC, EEPROM, SD card, WiFi, and other modules compatible with Arduino. Contains a large library of crop data to select from that will automatically aim the system for the best growing parameters during the various growth phases for the system configured, along with fully customizable weekly feed/additive amounts and daily feeding/lighting scheduling. With the right setup Hydruino can automatically do things like: enable grow lights for the needed period each day (potentially only turning on to augment daily sunlight hours), drive water pumps and auto-dosers during feedings, spray leafy plants in the morning before lights/sunrise, heat cold water to a specific temp for tropical plants, use CO2 sensors to manage air circulation fans to maintain optimal grow tent parameters, remind when to prune plants, or even use soil moisture sensing to dynamically determine watering schedule.
